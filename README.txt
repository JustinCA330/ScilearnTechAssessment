For testing, these programs run on node.
If you do not have node installed, you may simply download it directly from their website:
	https://nodejs.org/en/

Alternatively, you may download it on macOS using the package manager, Homebrew:
	https://brew.sh/
And then run this command on your terminal:
	$ brew install node

To run the programs:
1. On your terminal, change to your project directory.
2. Then run each program by using the ‘node’ command.
	$ node PhoneNumber.js
	$ node Bob.js
	$ node Meetup.js

PhoneNumber.js will display tests for two valid phone numbers and three invalid phone numbers.
Bob.js will display a mock conversation with Bob, and passes different kinds of strings to the hey() function.
Meetup.js will display the meetup date returned as an object. There is also a function that displays different dates’ information in a nice format.
